Sequencing data was aligned to Mmul10 Ensembl release 100 using STAR 2.7.3a [1]. 
Transcript abundance estimates were calculated using the STAR '--quantMode GeneCounts'
option. DESeq2 was used for transcript normalization and differential expression
analysis [2]. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the fGSEA R package [3]
with pathway definition defined in the Hallmark collection of MSigDB [4, 5].
