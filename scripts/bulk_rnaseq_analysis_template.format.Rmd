# DGE {.tabset}

This section of the report analyses gene expression between groups of samples within the study. Changes in gene expression between groups are usually reported on a log2 scale. The significance of a detected change in expression is reported in a raw/nominal p-value and a multiple-testing corrected/adjusted p-value that accounts for the large number of tests conducted in differential gene expression (DGE) and the inherent false positive rate assumed with frequentest p-values.

Each tab has results from a specific comparison within the study. Each tab shows 

1. A summary of significantly differentially expressed genes (DGE)

2. A volcano plot of DGE

3. A table of all significant DGE

The order of terms in tab labeling informs how to interpret results. For log-fold change and enrichment, the first listed group is the numerator and the second is the denominator. So in a comparison of X vs Y, a positive log-fold change means the gene is more highly expressed in X, while a negative change means the gene is more highly expressed in Y.

# Genes of interest {.tabset}

These heatmaps show the relative expression (regularized and log2 transformed) of genes for each sample normalized to the baseline (mean expression for pre-treatment samples). Individual samples are grouped within their treatment/timepoint. If you have genes you are interested in seeing from your study, we can plot them here.

# GSEA

The order of terms in tab labeling informs how to interpret results. For log-fold change and enrichment, the first listed group is the numerator and the second is the denominator. So in a comparison of X vs Y, a positive enrichment relates to enrichment in X, and negative enrichment indicates greater enrichment in Y. 

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a statistical approach to test systematic changes in groups of genes corresponding to biological pathways. A pathway is generally 'enriched' in one study group if the genes in that pathway are systematically up or down regulated in a manner and magnitude that is unlikely to be due to chance.
